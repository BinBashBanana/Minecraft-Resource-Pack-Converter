# Minecraft-1.13-To-1.12-Resource-Pack-Converter
A simple python script to convert Minecraft 1.13 resource packs to 1.12. You *will* have to change the pack.mcmeta "pack_format" field from 4 to 3. Place the converter.py file in the same location as the "assets" folder, the pack.mcmeta and the pack.png files of the resource pack you'd like to convert.
